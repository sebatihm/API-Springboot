== User Management
=== User information
The API allows to get information on the currently logged on user
via a `GET` on `/api/users/me`. If you are not a logged on user, the
following response will be returned:

operation::own-details-unauthorized[snippets='http-request,http-response']

If you do log on as a user, you get more information on that user:

operation::own-details[snippets='http-request,http-response,response-fields']

=== Create a user
To create an new user, do a `POST` on `/api/users`:

operation::create-user[snippets='http-request,request-fields,http-response,response-
fields']
